2. Flask 2.3.2
3. Pandas 2.0.3
4. Numpy 1.24.4
5. Sklearn 1.3.0

# Usage :
To use the Machine Learning model an intractive front end web application is provided. You can simply check price of the car by providing it the requested details.
Unfortunately, all details needed by the model for prediction. However it is featured that in case of absence of the detail a default value will be picked.

# Features :
Currently the application is up with the price prediction model for demonstraction. I hope to develope this model further for other vehical as well.
